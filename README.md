# Classification with Naive Bayes
This Python code is developed for developed for number classification over MNIST data-set. The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. It was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews paper:

Ken Lang, Newsweeder: Learning to fillter netnews, Proceedings of the Twelfth International Conference on Machine Learning, 331-339 (1995).

Though he did not explicitly mention this collection. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for
experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classiffcation and text
clustering.
The data is organized into 20 different newsgroups, each corresponding to a different topic. Here

The original data set is available at http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/.

Required packages for Python 3.7 are numpy, pandas, time and sklearn.metrics.

The code should be placed next to '20Newsgroups' folder. This folder should contain these CSV files:
./20newsgroups/train_data.csv

./20newsgroups/train_label.csv

./20newsgroups/test_data.csv

./20newsgroups/test_label.csv
